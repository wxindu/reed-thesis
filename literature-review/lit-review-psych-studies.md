**Social Media Use and Adolescent Mental Health: Findings From the UK Millennium Cohort Study**
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537018300609
- 2017; Oxford
- This paper focuses specifically on social media use and mental health. Moreover, as stated in the paper, it mainly focused on: 
    - i) assesses whether social media use is associated with adolescents' depressive symptoms,
    - ii) investigates multiple potential explanatory pathways via online harassment, sleep, self-esteem and body image.
- MCS data was used
- Purpose: 
    - To assess whether social media use is associated with depressive symptoms in adolescnets
    - To investigate potential explanatory pathways for observed associations - via online harassment, sleep, self-sesteem and body image. 
- Variable used for technology: 
    - This paper focuses particularly on social media use. They used the variable asking for hours on social media on week day. They transformed the variable, so instead of having 7 levels, they used a variable with 5 levels, "none", "<1h", "1 - <3h",...
- Variable used for mental well-being:
    - "Participants completed theMood and Feelings Questionnaire – short version (SMFQ) from which a summed score was created [28]. The SMFQ comprises 13 items on affective symptoms in the last 2 weeks
(see Box 1). In supplementary analysis we derived a binary variable to capture the presence of clinically relevant symptoms using a cut point of ≥12"
- Control Variables: 
    - Questionnaire items on online harassment, sleep, self-esteem and body image; family income – equivalised fifths; family structure (two vs one parent); and age in years
- Method
    - linear regression with: 
        - Model 0 – social media use plus confounders (family income, family structure, age, internalising symptoms at age 11) 
        - Model 1 – M0 plus online harassment 
        - Model 2 – M0 plus sleep quantity and quality (sleep hours, latency and disruption) 
        - Model 3 – M0 plus self-esteem
        - Model 4 – M0 plus body image (happy with appearance and body weight satisfaction)
- Note-worthy findings: 
    - Greater social media use related to online harassment, poor sleep, low self-esteem and poor body image; in turn these related to higher depressive symptomscores
    - Multiple potential intervening pathways were apparent, for example: greater hours social media use related to body weight dissatisfaction (≥5 h 31% more likely to be dissatisfied), which in turn linked to depressive symptom scores directly (body dissatisfaction 15% higher depressive symptom scores) and indirectly via self-esteem.

**Do television and electronic games predict children's psychosocial adjustment? Longitudinal research using the UK Millennium Cohort Study**
- https://adc.bmj.com/content/98/5/341?__hstc=258350677.96fa4fac36c81684c5efc9c0405ec622.1455235200101.1455235200102.1455235200103.1&__hssc=258350677.1.1455235200104&__hsfp=3972014050
- This paper focuses specifically on watching TV and electronic games and psychosocial adjustment. 
- MCS data was used
- purpose: 
    - explore how time watching TV and playing electronic games at age 5 years each predicts change in psychosocial adjustment in a representative sample of 7--year-olds from the UK
- method: 
    - regression
- Variables used for technology: 
    - daily hours viewing tv and playing electronic games
- Variables used for mental well being (or related):
    - Conduct problems, emotional symptoms, peer relationship problems, hyperactivity/inattention and prosocial behaviour were reported by mothers using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Change in adjustment from age 5 years to 7 years was used. 
- Result: 
    - TV but not electronic games predicted a small increase in conduct problems. Screen time did not
predict other aspects of psychosocial adjustment. Further work is required to establish causal mechanisms.

**Longitudinal associations between television in the bedroom and body fatness in a UK cohort study**
- https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2017129
- This paper focuses specifically on "screen-based media" use, including TV and computer use and TV in the bedroom, and body fatness. 
- MCS data was used
- Variables used for technology: TV and computer use and TV in the bedroom
- Variables used for mental well being (or related): NA
- Result: having a bedroom TV at age 7 years was associated with significantly higher BMI and FMI and increased risk of being overweight (relative risk (RR) at age 11 years, compared with having no bedroom TV. Hours spent watching TV or digital versatile disks were associated with increased risk of overweight among girls only. Computer use at age 7 years was not related to later body fatness for either gender.

**A Large-Scale Test of the Goldilocks Hypothesis: Quantifying the Relations Between Digital-Screen Use and the Mental Well-Being of Adolescents**
- https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616678438
- This paper focuses specifically on "digital screen time", including time spent on "watching films and other media (e.g., TV programs), playing games (e.g., on computers and consoles), using computers (e.g., Internet, e-mail), and using smartphones (e.g., social networking, chatting online).", and adolescents' mental well being. 
- Note-worthy: 
    - *displacement hypothesis* (Neuman, 1988): the harms of technology are directly proportional to exposure; Effects are claimed to be negative because digital activities supplant alternate activities such as socializing with peers and family, reading books, or exercising. 
    - *digital Goldilocks hypothesis* (Etchells, Gage, Rutherford, & Munafo, 2016; Parkes, Sweeting, Wight, & Henderson, 2013; Przybylski, 2014) tech use at moderate levels is not intrinsically harmful, and may be advantageous in a connected world, whereas "overuse" may indeed displace alternate activities. "too little" tech use may deprive young people of important social information and peer pursuits. The hypothesis postulates that there are empirically derivable balance points, moderate levels, that are "just right" for optimally connected young people. 
    - studies found evidence that digital engagement, including games, may not be disruptive, may even support development. 
    - "The research reported here was the first to systematically test for curvilinear relations between well-being and screen time measured continuously, separately for different digital activities and days of the week." 
    - Did not include which year the MCS study was used
- Variables used for technology: 
    - "Participants were asked four questions regarding their engagement in different kinds of digital activities during their free time. Specifically, they were asked about watching films and other media (e.g., TV programs), playing games (e.g., on computers and consoles), using computers (e.g., Internet, e-mail), and using smartphones (e.g., social networking, chatting online)."
    - "Finally, when we examined the distributions of total digital-screen time, the sums of the estimates, it was clear that many participants had reported simultaneous screen use; approximately 20% of the sample reported a sum of more than 12 hr of engagement on weekdays, and 35% of the sample reported a total of more than 12 hr on weekend days. Given that these values were consistent with earlier research demonstrating that digital media are often used in parallel (Eynon & Helsper, 2015), it did not make theoretical or practical sense to follow the original plan to test these summed screen-time estimates."
- Variables used for mental well being (or related): 
    - Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale was used to measure the happinessm life satisfcation, psychological functioning and social functioning of paricipants. 
- Control variables: 
    - gender; 
    - binary variable: 1 if residence in an area in the upper two quintiles of the multiple deprivation index (high scores on unemployment, crime, poor public servicesm barriers to housing), 0 if residence in an are in the lower two quintiles; 
    - binary variable: 0 if self-identified as white, 1 otherwise. 
- Method: 
    - preregistered analytic strategy available osf.io/b4cgq
    - both linear and quadratic regression
    - look at tech use separately: films & TV; games; computers; smartphones;
    - look at weekday/weekend separately
- Result: 
    - significant quadratic term
    - links vary as a functon of when digital tech are used (weekday vs weekend)
    - "the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world. The findings inform recommendations for limiting adolescents’ technology use and provide a template for conducting rigorous investigations into the relations between digital technology and children’s and adolescents’ health."

- **Looked at the different tech separately; evidence that not appropriate to use the sum of hours of different tech**
- **Considered when the tech was used**
- **quadratic regression**

**Do Social Network Sites Enhance or Undermine Subjective Well-Being? A Critical Review**
- http://selfcontrol.psych.lsa.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sipr12033.pdf
- This paper focuses on reviewing the existing literature and consider the consequences of interacting with social network sites for subjective well-being. They found two main results: 1. "passively"using social network sites has negative relationship with subjective well-being; 2. "actively" using social network sites has positive relationship with subjective well-being. 
- Note-worthy: 
    - "Studies examining the impact of overall internet usage on subjective wellbeing are not included here, as categorizing all internet activities (including social network usage) into one overarching category is considered suboptimal (Bessiere, Kiesler, Kraut, & Boneva, 2008; Burke, Kraut, & Marlow, 2011). **Evidence in literature of categorize internet activities into overarching category is suboptimal**
    - The article provided detailed features of what was understood as "social network sites" and "subjective well-being."
    - The article reviewed two type of existing studies: 
        - early empirical studies on overall social network usage and subjective well-being: encompasses studies that assess time spent on social network sites without specifying how people interact with such sites when they are on them. 
        - recent studies that examine the relationship between different forms of social network usage and subjective well-being (active usage vs passive usage)
    - The designs of the studies can be mainly categorized as: cross-sectional designs; longitudinal designs; experimental designs. Due to our interest in topic, look at the longitudinal designs. On study was discussed in the early empirical studies: 
        - "They found that Facebook usage predicted decreases in affective subjective well-being over time such that participants felt 8% worse when they engaged Facebook usage “a lot” during the time period between any two affect assessments compared to when they did not use Facebook at all. In contrast, affective subjective wellbeing did not predict subsequent changes in Facebook usage."
        - (In general, "initial studies on overall usage of social networks sites and subjective well-being" result in a mixed pattern of findings. 
        - On study found active Facebook user are positively related to life satisfaction, the opposite for passive Facebook use; One study found no effect on subjective well-being from active Facebook usage but declines in well-being over time by passive usage; Another study found similar result as the first one; another study found negative effect from passive usage of Facebook on some assessments but not cognitive subjective well-being, no effct for active usage. 
    - The study also provided lots of information on how to understand the relationship between social network sites and subjective well-being. Need to refer back when later constructing own SCA models. (And also refer back for details in actual writing, too many details so not include here)
