- **Title:** *The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use*
- **Summary:** The paper examines correlational evidence for the effects of digital technology on adolescents using **Specification curve analysis (SCA)** across *three* large-scale social datasets, and found a resulted effect that's small and suggested that the effects are too small to warrant policy change. 
- **How does this relate?** This paper inspires the thesis. The method **SCA** seems to be misused in the paper. We'd like to focus on the statistical method and possibly figure out the correct way to conduct the study that's done in this paper.
