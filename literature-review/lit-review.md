- **Author:** Amy Orben and Andrew K. Przybylski
- **Year:** 2019
- **Title:** *The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use*
- **Summary:** The paper examines correlational evidence for the effects of digital technology on adolescents using **Specification curve analysis (SCA)** across *three* large-scale social datasets, and found a resulted effect that's small and suggested that the effects are too small to warrant policy change. 
- **How does this relate?** This paper inspires the thesis. The method **SCA** seems to be misused in the paper. We'd like to focus on the statistical method and possibly figure out the correct way to conduct the study that's done in this paper.

- **Title:** Probing Birth-Order Effects on Narrow Traits Using Specification-Curve Analysis
- **Summary:** Another psychology study used SCA
- **How does this relate?** This paper is cited by Orben 2019. It uses the same SCA method proposed by Simonsohn et al. Still need to determine whether or not the SCA is used correctly in this paper.

- **Title:** Detecting and avoiding likely false-positive findings â€“ a practical guide
- **Summary:** Discusses about the replication crisis, the sources of errors and possible solutions
- **Hoe does this relate?** In the paper the SCA was briefly mentioned and discussed. In this paper, the SCA was described as "try all versions to examine robustness of findings". One other paper (Steegen *et al.*, 2016 was mentioned and seems to perform similar method (or method for similar purpose) as SCA
