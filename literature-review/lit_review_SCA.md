**A Measure of Robustness to Misspecification**
- https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151020
- This paper proposed a method to assess the model sensitivity to specifications, using a robustness measure that focuses on the standard deviation of the point estimates over the set of models.
- Relationship: cited by SCA paper; similar purpose. 
- Idea of Specifications: **[To be added]**
