## Orben's

### MCS (Millennium Cohort Study)

- The data used by Orben is *Millennium Cohort Study: Sixth Survey* [SN8156], can be found here: https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/millennium-cohort-study/mcs-age-14-sweep/ or http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8156-4 
- The data are safeguarded, 
> "'Safeguarded' is currently the Office for National Statistics’s preferred term for data which we provide under the UK Data Service’s End User Licence (EUL)."

- Seems like data are accessible for registered users. If not in UK and/or not part of an organization on the list of federation members for UK Access Management Federation, we must request username to register. I've sent out a request (12:40pm 9/30/2019) and it's said that they need about three working days to process the request. 

### MTF (Monitoring the Future)

- The data are publicly available at https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/studies/36799/version/1
- The .rda file has been found and saved locally. 

### YRBS (Youth Risk Behavior Survey)

- Data are publicly available at https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm 
- It was referenced in Orben's paper *Johnston, L. D., Bachman, J. G., O’Malley, P. M., Schulenberg, J. E. & Miech,R. A. Monitoring the future: a continuing study of American Youth (8th- and 10th-Grade Surveys)*. The study used YRBS data from 2014-2015 time period. The dataset is found and saved locally.
