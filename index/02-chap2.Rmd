# Replication and Evaluation {#replication}

This section discusses the attempt to replicate Orben's study along with the assessment of the use of SCA in this study. We begin by introducing the three datasets used, which can all be found through public sources under permission. We then discuss in detail the attempt to replicate the study, including the obstacles to overcome during the replication process. 

## Data and Reprocessing

\par Three large-scale social datasets were used in Orben's study: Monitoring the Future (MTF) from the US, Youth Risk and Behavior Survey (YRBS) from the US, and Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) from the United Kingdom. The three datasets were all survey data obtained from the scientific study of the same name, and encompass survey answers from adolescents aged predominately 12-18 from 2007 to 2016. The datasets provided wide measures of adolescents' psychological well-being and digital technology use. A considerable number of psychology studies in the existing literature were conducted based on large-scale studies, which provided a wide selection of approaches to modeling and analysis based on the specific dataset. In this section, we discuss the background information of the three datasets and the reprocessing of the data obtained from public sources. 
    
### YRBS

\par The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance was first launched in 1990, and it's a biennial survey of adolescents that reflects a nationally representative sample of students attending secondary schools. Orben's study focused on the data collected from 2007 to 2015, and the same set of data was obtained. While Orben used data in SPSS format, we were only able to access the data through Microsoft Access. The datasets were extracted and saved under excel format. It was confirmed that the same number of observations were included in the obtained dataset as the data used by Orben, 37,402 girls and 37,412 boys from 2007 to 2015. It was also confirmed that all variables used in Orben's study are contained in the obtained dataset. Most of the work in the preprocessing step for YRBS focused on transforming the characteristic values of the variables into corresponding numerical values.  

\par One noticeable obstacle in this step was that, since the study is conducted annually and is still ongoing, the survey questions and indexings have been updated several times in recent years. The majority of the variables in the datasets are named after the survey questions indexes, and the recent updates in survey questions result in differences of indices for survey questions between the current survey and surveys conducted before 2015. This leads to mismatches between variable names in the incorporated dataset including data from the year of 2015 and prior--the one used by Orben--and the variable names in the dataset obtained for this study, including data from the year of 2017 and prior. Careful research and recoding are done to ensure the correct set of variables was used for the replication. 

### MTF

\par Monitoring the Future was first launched in the year of 1975, and it is an annual nationally representative survey of approximately 50,000 US adolescents in grades 8, 10 and 12. Surveys on adolescents in grade 12 were not used in the analysis since "many of the key items of interest cannot be correlated in their survey". Orben focused on the data collected from 2008 to 2016, which included 136,190 girls and 132,482 boys. The data are publicly accessible. In Orben's study, a merged dataset containing MTF data from 2008 to 2016 was used. While the MTF data for each year is publicly accessible, no access to a merged MTF dataset for the specified period have been found. From 2008 to 2016, the survey has been updated multiple times, along with one major change in data file format after RStudio's release in the year of 2011. Due to the frequent updates in the annual surveys and changes in data files, the variable names vary greatly among the available datasets. This brings excessive difficulties to obtain the same dataset as used in Orben's study for replication purposes. 

### MCS

\par The Millennium Cohort Study follows a specific cohort of children born between September 2000 and January 2001 and collects data from both the children and the caregivers. Orben's study focused specifically on the data collected in 2015 when the participated children were aged between 13 and 15. The sample included 5926 girls and 5946 boys along with 10605 caregivers. The same dataset as used by Orben was obtained. Access to the data is open to the public but requires specific permission. While Orben obtained data in CSV format, we were only able to obtain data in SPSS format. The same set of observations, with 5926 girls and 5946 boys born between September 2000 and January 2001, were included in the dataset, along with the same set of variables as used in Orben's study. 

\par Unlike working with YRBS and MTF, the variable names in the obtained dataset matches well with the variable names in the dataset used by Orben. However, instead of using numerical indices to represent survey answers, in the dataset obtained, the variable values were all in characters. After careful reprocessing, all variable values were transformed into the exact numerical indices matching with the values of the variables as were in Orben's study. However, two variables--one related to family incomes and one related to siblings--had only NA values in the obtained dataset. The omissions might be done for confidential purposes. The two variables were used as control variables in Orben's study. As we fail to obtain the two variables, they were removed for this attempt to replicate. 

## Replication

\par After obtaining the datasets we began the replication of Orben's study. The replication consists of two parts, the replication of generating a single specification curve for each dataset, and the replication of the inferential specification curve analysis, which assesses the significance of the single SCA result. The code used for Orben's study is publicly available on the Open Science Framework website ([@OrbenCode]), and all replications were performed based on the provided code. In the following section, we discuss the procedure, obstacles, and specific resolutions to the obstacles of replicating the analysis. 

### SCA

\par The first part of the replication is to replicate the single SCA analysis for each dataset. While all work done in this section is based on the code provided on OSF, due to the necessary reprocessings mentioned in the previous sections, slight modifications were made for smooth replication.

\par As mentioned in Chapter 1, three types of specifications were identified by Orben. Based on the public code, we were able to obtain the same set of specifications as used in Orben's study. A note-worthy obstacle is that, due to a large number of specification models determined for the MCS study, a random subset of 10,004 specification models was used instead. A seed is not provided by Orben for the random subset, thus we failed to obtain the same subset of specification models for this SCA analysis. We instead randomly generated our subset of 20,004 specifications. This randomness may result in a discrepancy in this specification curve. Considering that the random subset has a large size, we expect the degree of this discrepancy to be small. And this expectation is confirmed by replication result: while Orben obtained the median coefficient of the independent variable to be $\text{Median}(\beta) = -0.032$, our replication obtained $\text{Median}(\beta) = -0.0328$.

\par The problem does not exist for the studies YRBS and MTF. There were fewer variables available in the dataset relating to technology use and adolescent mental well-being. The number of specifications identified in the two studies is in a reasonable size, therefore the exact set of specifications was used for the replications. The result matched well with Orben's result. The median coefficient of the independent variable in the YRBS study was found to be $Median(\beta) = -0.035$  in Orben's study. The result obtained in this replication, when rounded to the same digits, is also -0.035. 

### Bootstrapping test

\par The next part of the replication is to replicate the inference of the single specification curves for each dataset. Orben chose to use a bootstrapping test on the median overall point estimate for the significance of the result. We will later assess the choice of the inference test and the correctness of the inference. For now, we focus only on replicating the test and the result. 

\par 500 specification curves were conducted in Orben's study on bootstrapped samples for each of the three datasets. It was found that the test statistic for the single specification curves was statistically significant in all three cases. The initial attempt of the replication was done using the original code as provided on the OSF website. However, due to the large sizes of the three datasets and the great number of loops used in the R code, the replication process was extremely computationally intense. A single specification curve will take around 8 hours to be generated, and performing 500 specification curves will take nearly 24 weeks. An ARC computer cluster at Oxford was used by Orben to reduce running time, however, no access to such an advanced computer is available for this replication. Therefore, instead of using purely the original code, the code for this replication was rewritten for parallel running. The running time has been significantly reduced. The dataset YRBS has the least number of observations and specifications, and after the recoding, it now takes about 9 hours to generate a complete bootstrapping distribution of 500 specification curves on a Rstudio server with 8 cores. With access to an AWS server with 96 cores, the running time can be further reduced. More time will be needed for the other two datasets, as the number of observations and specifications can be much higher in those two cases, but still within a computationally reasonable time range. 

\par As mentioned earlier, a seed was not provided in Orben's study. Therefore we cannot fully replicate the randomness of a bootstrapping test. The boostrapped samples in this replication are different than the samples used in Orben's work, and this could result in a difference between the results of Orben's and this replication. 

[ZJZJ Results will be added once the full implementation of the bootstrapping test implementation is finished for all three datasets. It is now completed for YRBS and MCS. MTF data still wrangling (very time consuming, progress <50% 4/5/2020).] 


## Evaluating Orben's work

\par A full replication allows a full understanding of Orben's approach and procedure. It is only when we have a full understanding of the work that our critiques and assessments on it will be responsible and reliable. In this section, we talk in detail about our critiques on the usage of the SCA method in Orben's study, including some fundamental misunderstanding of the intentions and applicabilities of the SCA method, inappropriate choice of specifications, and misinterpretation of the SCA results. We also compare Orben's procedures with the procedures taken by Rohrer et al when studying the effect of birth-order position on personality, which is considered a more reasonable and appropriate application of the SCA method. 


### "one-to-many" mapping from scientific to statistical hypotheses

\par We start from assessing the research question of this study. The article is titled "The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use". As addressed in the paper, the main focus of this paper is to study the association between digital technology use and adolescent well-being. This is a broad topic to be studied. Intuitively, one could consider the different types of digital technologies to mean very different things. For adolescents, the different digital technologies may have very distinct functions. It would not be intuitively right to say that the functions of social media are identical to those of TV for modern teenagers. The interactive nature of certain types of digital technologies makes a distinction between them and other devices, which only transmit and output information. Intuitively, it does not sound right to consider that the distinct digital technologies would have similar effects on adolescent well-being. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to consider the different technologies as alternative representations of an integrated category. However, throughout Orben's study, a different type of digital technologies including "TV use", "Social Media use", "Time spent on electronic games" are considered alternative variables to use representing "digital technology use". With a glance, it seems like multiple related but different research questions have been collapsed into one. As discussed by Gelman and Loken (2013), the \emph(scientific) hypotheses described here correspond to multiple \emph{statistical hypotheses}. Whatever results conducted by this study, due to the broad research question, they would be fit into theories easily. This will result in the multiple comparison problem in the study, even if the scientists were not intended to do so. 

\par It has been studied in the field of Psychology that categorizing certain types of digital technology use into a broader overarching category is inappropriate. Studies suggest, for example, that categorizing the different types of internet activities (such as interactive usage of social media and passive consumption of social media) into an overarching category is suboptimal. (Bessiere, Kiesler, Kraut, \& Boneva, 2008; Burke, Kraut, \& Marlow, 2011; Verduyn, Ybarra, Resibois, Jonides \& Kross, 2017) It's also been found with an overall reviewing on the consequences of interacting with social network sites for subjective well-being that, "passively" using social networks result in a negative relationship with subject well-being, while "actively" using social networks has a positive relationship with subject well-being. If different styles of using social network can have different relationships with subject well-being, it does not sound appropriate to consider the general usage of social media would have identical relationship with subject well-being as the usage of other technologies, such as television which provides mainly browsing of information, or electronic games which would have distinct functions depending on type of games.

\par Recall from Chapter 1, that the appropriate set of specifications considered for an SCA analysis is a set of operational decisions specific to a pre-determined research question and study design. Visualization of such a set of specifications was shown in figure \@ref(fig:OpeDecSCA). In this case, however, instead of conducting a study based on a specific research question, Orben may have considered multiple of them as alternatives to each other. 

```{r OrbenRQ, fig.cap="Orben may have considered multiple research questions as alternatives to each other instead of choosing a specific research question from the general topic, which is what should have been done to conduct an appropriate SCA analysis.", out.width = 450, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figure/Orben_ResearchQ.png")
```

\par Such problem does not exist in the work conducted by Rohrer et al. ([@Rohrer]) By Rohrer et al., 11 specific research questions of interest are determined, and an SCA analysis is conducted for each specific research question. The research questions pre-determined the specific variables of interest. For example, one of the research questions studies the effect of birth-order position on life satisfaction. While there may be many different ways of measuring life satisfaction, there is much less ambiguity of what is represented by this term. Life satisfaction can be considered as being part of the category of personality, while technology use is more like a general category that is on the same level of personality. 

### Choice of Specifications 

\par The specifications determined by Orben, due to the choice of multiple different research questions, are indeed specifications in light of different underlying theories. While one specification suggests using the variable on TV used to represent general digital technology use, a different specification suggests using the variable on electronic games use to represent general digital technology use. The stories told by these different models generated by the different specifications may be very different. When performing SCA on such specifications, it's not only the impact of arbitrary operationalizations of the models that are moderated but also the impact of non-arbitrary theorizing that's moderated. This conflicts with the true intention and appropriate usage of SCA. 

\par It's also worth mentioning that the specifications determined by Orben in this study are all specifications relating to the inclusion/exclusion of variables. The determined specifications can be categorized into three types: 1. specifications on the choice of the dependent variable, 2. specifications on the choice of the independent variable, 3. whether or not to include a pre-determined list of control variables. However, the SCA should consider a full set of combinations of operationalization decisions instead of just those of variable selections. Important operationalization decisions, such as the recoding of the variables as performed by Orben in the data processing step before actual analysis, are decisions that can have an important effect on the result and are not being considered in this study. 

```{r OrbenOD, fig.cap="The set of specifications considered by Orben", out.width = 450, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figure/studyDesignOrben.png")
include_graphics(path = "figure/OpeDec_Orben.png")
```

\par The above figures provide an overall visualization of the specifications considered in Orben's study. Instead of considering one full set of combinations of operational decisions under a specific research question and study design, Orben considered a subset of operational decisions under multiple research questions. The outputs from the different branches are collapsed together into one analysis. This is, very clearly, different from an appropriate design of SCA analysis. 

\par We can compare this choice of specifications to the one did by Rohrer et al. The following is the list of the specifications determined in the paper. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Different ways to measure the personality variable; 
    \item Use raw scores or age-adjusted scores; 
    \item Within-family or between-family analyses; 
    \item Which definition of birth-order position to use: the social definition or the more restrictive definition limited to full siblings; 
    \item Differentiation of each birth-order position within a sibship (e.g., first, second, third) or differentiation only of firstborn from later positions; 
    \item Inclusion of all sibships or sibships with spacing does not exceed 5 years, or sibships with sibling spacing exceeded 1.5 years but did not exceed 5 years between any two siblings; 
    \item Exclusion of any gender effects, the inclusion of the main effect of gender, or inclusion or both the main effect of gender and the interaction of birth-order position and gender; 
    \item Analysis of the complete sample, analysis of only individuals from sibships with 2 to 4 children, or separate analyses for sibships of 2, 3, and 4 children.
\end{enumerate}

\par The specifications determined above can be mainly categorized into the following types: variable measurement decisions, variable transformation decisions and outlier decisions. Different combinations of specifications do not change the research question being studied, and are mainly reasonable alternative ways of conducting an analysis for this specific topic. 

### SCA interpretation

\par The last major problem of this study is the way Orben interprets the single SCA result. As discussed in the previous chapter, the single SCA generated is used for a descriptive curve that can provide information on whether or not the relationship appears to be happening by chance, and if a certain pattern of a true relationship is observed, if the relationship appears to be robust in response to changes in specifications. The single specification curve should not be used for any interpretation of the actual magnitude of the numerical values of the estimates. However in Orben's study, when interpreting the single generated specification curve, the median values of the $\beta$ estimates were used and the magnitudes of the numerical value were considered. Here is a quote from the study: 

\begin{quote}
  The SCAs showed that there is a small negative association between technology use and well-being, ...
\end{quote}

\par The "SCAs" here refers to the single specification curve generated for each of the three datasets, MTF, YRBS, and MCS. And the "small negative association" was concluded from the median estimate of the $\beta$'s from models with changing specifications. Nowhere suggested by Simonsohn et al describes this interpretation of the numerical result from a specification curve. The three examples provided in the original paper describing the method do not make such conclusions from a single specification curve but only used it to assess if the relationship seems strong and which specifications appear to have the largest effect on the estimate. When conducting inferential tests for the three examples, the medians were only used to check statistical significance. The numerical values of the medians were never considered to be meaningful. 

\par It is worth mentioning here that the application performed by Rohrer et al. did not interpret the numerical values of the test statistics, following the instructions suggested by Simonsohn et al. The analysis interpretations of the SCA results follow closely the examples provided in the work of Simonsohn et al. While it is unknown of the rationale behind Orben's innovative steps when conducting the SCA analysis, Chapter 3 provides a detailed discussion of why these innovations may in fact provide unreliable results and interpratations.
