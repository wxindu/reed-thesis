# Replication {#replication}

This section discusses the attempt to replicate Orben's study, understand how SCA is used in the study, and summarize the methodological flaws in this application. All three datasets used in Orben's study can be found through public sources. The code used for this replication were forked from Orben's github site and modified to fit with data obtained. 

## Data and Reprocessing

\par Three large-scale social datasets were used in Orben's study: Monitoring the Future (MTF) from the US [cite], Youth Risk and Behavior Survey (YRBS) from the US [cite], and Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) from the United Kingdom [cite]. The three datasets were all survey data obtained from scientific study of the same name, and encompass survey answers from adolescents aged predominately 12-18 in the time period of 2007 to 2016. The datasets provided wide measures of adolescents' psychological well-being and digital technology use. A considerable number of psychology studies in the existing literature were conducted based on the large-scale studies, which provided wide selection of approaches to modeling and analysis based on the specific dataset. 
    
### YRBS

\par The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance was first launched in 1990, and it's a biennial survey of adolescents that reflects a nationally representative sample of students attending secondary schools. Orben focused on the data collected during the time period of 2007 to 2015. The same dataset as used by Orben was obtained. While Orben used data in SPSS format, we obtained data through Microsoft Access and extracted the datasets into excel format. The same number of observations, 37,402 girls and 37,412 boys from 2007 to 2015 are included, along with the same set of variables as used by Orben. One noticeable obstacle in this step was, since the study is conducted anually and is still ongoing, the survey questions and indexings have been updated in the recent years. The majority of the variables in the dataset are named after the indexes for survey questions. The recent updates in survey questions result in differences of indices for survey questions between the current survey and surveys conducted prior to 2015. This lead to mismatches between variable names in the incorporated dataset including data from year of 2015 and prior--the one used by Orben--and the variable names in the dataset obtained for this study, including data from the year of 2017 and prior. Careful research and recoding have been done to ensure the exact same set of variables was used for the replication. 

### MTF

\par Monitoring the Future was first launched in the year of 1975, and it is an annual nationally representative survey of approximately 50,000 US adolescents in grades 8, 10 and 12. Surveys on adolescents in grade 12 were not used in the analysis since "many of the key items of interest cannot be correlated in their survey". Orben focused on the data collected during the time period of 2008 to 2016, which included 136,190 girls and 132,482 boys. The data are publicly accessible. In Orben's study, a merged dataset containing MTF data from 2008 to 2016 was used. While the MTF data for each year is publicly accessible, no access to a merged MTF dataset for the specified time period was found. During the time period of 2008 to 2016, the survey has been updated multiple times, along with one major change in data file format after RStudio's release in the year of 2011. Due to the frequent updates in the annual surveys and changes in data files, the variable names vary greatly among the available datasets. This bring excessive difficulties to obtain the exact same dataset as used in Orben's study for replication purpose. 

### MCS

\par The Millennium Cohort Study follows a specific cohort of children born between September 2000 and January 2001 and collects data from both the children and the caregivers. Orben's study focused specifically on the data collected in 2015, when the participated children were aged between 13 and 15. The sample included 5926 girls and 5946 boys along with 10605 caregivers. The same dataset as used by Orben was obtained. The access to the data is open to public but require specific permission. While Orben obtained data in csv format, we were only able to obtain data in SPSS format. The same set of observations, with 5926 girls and 5946 boys borned between September 2000 and January 2001, were included in the dataset, along with the same set of variables as used in Orben's study. Unlike working with YRBS and MTF, the variable names in the obtained dataset matches well with the variable names in the dataset used by Orben. However, instead of using numerical indices to represent survey answers, in the dataset obtained, the variable values were all in characters with the specific content refering to the specific survey answer. After careful reprocessing, all variable values were transformed to the exact numerical indices matching with the variables values as were in Orben's study. However, two variables--one related to family incomes and one related to siblings--had only NA values in the obtained dataset. The omissions might be done for confidential purpose. The two variables were used as control variables in Orben's study. As we fail to obtain the two variables, they were removed for this attempt to replication. 

## Replication

\par After obtainning the datasets we began the replication of Orben's study. The replication consists of two parts, the replication of a single SCA analysis for each dataset, and the replication of the SCA permutation test, which was used by Orben to assess the significance of the single SCA result. In the following section we discuss the procedure, obstacles and the specific resolutions to the obstacles of replicating the analysis. 

### SCA

\par The first part of the replication is to replicate the single SCA analysis for each dataset. All the replications in this section were done on the basis of original code provided by Orben in the public github repository. Due to the necessary reprocessings mentioned in the previous sections, slight modifications were made to the original code. 

\par All specifications used by Orben were about inclusion or exclusion of variables. More specifically, there were mainly three types of specifications used by Orben: (1) Which variable to use as the independent variable representing "technology use", (2) which variable to use as the dependent variable representing "adolescent well-being", (3) whether or not to include a pre-determined set of control variables in the regression. Orben proposed nearly 2.5 trillion alternative specifications for the MCS study. Considering the computational ability, Orben used a subset of 20,004 specifications for the SCA analysis on MCS data. While replicating the used specifications is ideal, Orben did not provide a seed for the random subsampling of the specifications. Thus we used a randomly generated subset of 20,004 specifications in this replication. As a result of this random subset, we would expect slight mismatch between our replication results and Orben's result in the MCS case. Considering that the random subset has large size, we expect the degree of this mismatch to be small. 

\par The problem does not exist for the studies YRBS and MTF. There were less variables available in the dataset which, according to Orben, could be used to represent technology use and adolescent well-being. The number of specifications identified in the two studies are reasonable size, so the exact set of specifications were used for the replications. The result matched well with Orben's result. The median coefficient of the independent variable in the YRBS study was found to be $Median(\beta) = -0.035$  in Orben's study. The result obtained in this replication, when rounded to the same digits, is also -0.035. 

\par The replication result for MCS, although not as perfect as the result for YRBS, was very close to Orben's result. While Orben obtained $Median(\beta) = -0.032$, this replication obtained $Median(\beta) = -0.0328$. The difference in results is very small. Considering the fact that we failed to obtain the exact same set of specifications used for the SCA, and that two control variables had to be taken out due to NA values, the difference in results should be reasonable. 

### Bootstrapping/Permutation test

(rewritten code to run parallel)
\par A bootstrapping test was used in Orben's study. 

## Methodological and Inferential Flaws

- Choice of specifications
    - Statistical hypothesis vs science hypothesis
    - valid alternative specifications? 
    - show evidence of running SCA or models when different independent variables are used
- inference of the result
    - the median estimated coefficient from a SCA model should not be inferenced as the estimated coefficient. Looking at the median does not taken into consideration of how the estimates vary among changes in specifications. 
    - A bootstrapping test was used to assess if the result of one SCA was significant, where Orben stated that the bootstrapping distribution represents the null distribution. This is not true. To estimate a null distribution a permutation test is more appropriate to be used. 

## Replication Obstacles

- Had to do lots of data processing to be able to run the code and replicate results. 
- Bootstrapping tests take long to be conducted. Orben used Oxford's server for those simulations. Need to (possibly) subset datasets to run the permutation tests in a reasonable amount of time.
