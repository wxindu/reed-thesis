  \section{Orben's Study}\label{orbens-study}
  
  \chapter{Replication}\label{replication}
  
  \section{Data}\label{data}
  
  \par 
  
  Three large-scale social datasets were used in Orben's study--Monitoring
  the Future (MTF) and Youth Risk and Behavior Survey (YRBS) from the
  United States of America, and Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) from the
  United Kingdom. The three datasets encompass survey answers from
  adolescents aged predominately 12-18 in the time period of 2007 to 2016.
  The surveys provided measures of adolescents' psychological well-being
  and digital technology use and have been used in multiple existing
  psychology studies.
  
  \subsection{YRBS}\label{yrbs}
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    launched in 1990, a biennial survey of adolescents that reflects a
    nationally representative sample of students attending secondary
    schools.
  \item
    Used sample from 2007 to 2015, 37402 girls and 37412 boys were
    included in the study, age range from ``12 or younger'' to ``18 or
    older''
  \item
    Data were successfully found. While Orben used data in \texttt{.sav}
    file, was only able to obtain data in Microsoft Access format. Include
    same observations.
  \item
    Can be accessed publicly
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{MTF}\label{mtf}
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    launched in 1975, an annual nationally representative survey of
    approximately 50,000 US adolescents in grades 8, 10 and 12. Surveys on
    adolescents in grade 12 were not used in the analysis since ``many of
    the key items of interest cannot be correlated in their survey''.
  \item
    The sample used were collected from 2008 to 2016, included 136,190
    girls and 132,482 boys. Exact ages of the participants were removed
    for anonymization in the dataset.
  \item
    Data were successfully found. While Orben used data in \texttt{.sav}
    file, was only able to obtain data in \texttt{.rda} format.
  \item
    Can be accessed publicly
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{MCS}\label{mcs}
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Follows a specific cohort of children born between September 2000 and
    January 2001. Data were provided by both caregivers (parents) and
    adolescent participants.
  \item
    The sample used included 5926 girls and 5946 boys with age ranged from
    13 to 15. 10605 caregivers were also included.
  \item
    Data were successfully found. While Orben used data in \texttt{.csv}
    file, was only able to obtain data in \texttt{.sav} format.
  \item
    Needed to submit request for access of data
  \end{itemize}
  \section{Processing}\label{processing}
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    With a close look into Orben's code,
    \url{https://github.com/OrbenAmy/NHB_2019}, the values included in the
    datasets obtained were in different form than the values included in
    the datasets used by Orben. While Orben had all numerical values, with
    numbers being the index of survey answers, the datasets obtained had
    characteristic values, as a combination of numerical index and actual
    survey answer in characters. Data processing is thus needed to
    replicate Orben's code.
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{YRBS}\label{yrbs-1}
  
  \subsection{MTF}\label{mtf-1}
  
  \subsection{MCS}\label{mcs-1}
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    All variables used in Orben's study were reprocessed. Refered back to
    the survey questionnaire for the correct numerical index of survey
    answers. Most variables were successfully reprocessed and reruning
    Orben's code on the processed variables was successful
  \item
    Failed to obtain two variables. The variables had all NA values in the
    dataset. One related to family income and the other related to
    siblings at home. The two variables served as control variables in the
    SCA analysis. Thus both were removed to continue replication.
  \item
    All other code were ran successfully without significant changes.
    (only changed file directories)
  \end{itemize}
  \section{SCA Results}\label{sca-results}
  
  \subsection{YRBS}\label{yrbs-2}
  
  \subsection{MTF}\label{mtf-2}
  
  \subsection{MCS}\label{mcs-2}
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The replicated SCA result had \(\beta = -0.0328\), while in Orben's
    study \(\beta = -0.032\). The result obtained in the replication study
    is very close to the original result. Consider two variables were
    removed from the control group, the result seems reasonable.
  \end{itemize}
  \section{Replication Obstacles}\label{replication-obstacles}
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Had to do lots of data processing to be able to run the code and
    replicate results.
  \item
    Permutation tests take long to be conducted. Orben used Oxford's
    server for those simulations. Need to (possibly) subset datasets to
    run the permutation tests in a reasonable amount of time.
  \end{itemize}
  \chapter{Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels}\label{ref-labels}
  
  \section{Tables}\label{tables}
  
  In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a
  data frame in \textbf{R} that you saw in {[}R Markdown Basics{]} using
  the \texttt{kable} function, you can also create tables using
  \emph{pandoc}. (More information is available at
  \url{http://pandoc.org/README.html\#tables}.) This might be useful if
  you don't have values specifically stored in \textbf{R}, but you'd like
  to display them in table form. Below is an example. Pay careful
  attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows
  and columns.
  \begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
  \caption{\label{tab:inher} Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents
  and Child}\tabularnewline
  \toprule
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.29\columnwidth}\centering\strut

  \end{minipage}\tabularnewline

  \end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\centering\strut
  Slight\strut
  \end{minipage}\tabularnewline
  \bottomrule
  \end{longtable}
  We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table
  \ref{tab:inher}. If you go back to {[}Loading and exploring data{]} and
  look at the \texttt{kable} table, we can create a reference to this max
  delays table too: Table \ref{tab:maxdelays}. The addition of the
  \texttt{(\textbackslash{}\#tab:inher)} option to the end of the table
  caption allows us to then make a reference to Table
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(tab:label)}. Note that this reference could
  appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.
  
  \clearpage
  
  \section{Figures}\label{figures}
  
  If your thesis has a lot of figures, \emph{R Markdown} might behave
  better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will
  automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You'll
  also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then
  reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables
  earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and
  \emph{R Markdown} will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No
  need for you to remember! So that you don't have to get too far into
  LaTeX to do this, a couple \textbf{R} functions have been created for
  you to assist. You'll see their use below.
  
  In the \textbf{R} chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as
  \texttt{reed.jpg} in our main directory. We then give it the caption of
  ``Reed logo'', the label of ``reedlogo'', and specify that this is a
  figure. Make note of the different \textbf{R} chunk options that are
  given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).
  \begin{Shaded}
  \begin{Highlighting}[]
  \KeywordTok{include_graphics}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{path =} \StringTok{"figure/reed.jpg"}\NormalTok{)}
  \end{Highlighting}
  \end{Shaded}
  \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=3.47in]{figure/reed} \caption{Reed logo}\label{fig:reedlogo}
  \end{figure}
  Here is a reference to the Reed logo: Figure \ref{fig:reedlogo}. Note
  the use of the \texttt{fig:} code here. By naming the \textbf{R} chunk
  that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as
  done in the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the
  figure via the R chunk option \texttt{fig.cap}.
  
  \clearpage 
  
  Below we will investigate how to save the output of an \textbf{R} plot
  and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the
  \texttt{flights} dataset from Chapter \ref{rmd-basics}. (Note that we've
  shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will
  next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by
  airline from Portland for 2014. Note also the use of the \texttt{scale}
  parameter which is discussed on the next page.
  \begin{Shaded}
  \begin{Highlighting}[]
  \NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(carrier) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
  \StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mean_dep_delay =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(dep_delay)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
  \StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mean_dep_delay)) }\OperatorTok{+}
  \StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{position =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"red"}\NormalTok{)}
  \end{Highlighting}
  \end{Shaded}
  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{thesis_files/figure-latex/delaysboxplot-1.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:delaysboxplot}Mean Delays by Airline}
  \end{figure}
  Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:delaysboxplot}.
  
  A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at
  \url{https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv}.
  
  \clearpage
  
  Next, we will explore the use of the \texttt{out.extra} chunk option,
  which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by
  specifying \texttt{"scale=\ "}. Here we use the mathematical graph
  stored in the ``subdivision.pdf'' file.
  \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figure/subdivision} \caption{Subdiv. graph}\label{fig:subd}
  \end{figure}
  Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:subd}. Note that
  \texttt{echo=FALSE} is specified so that the \textbf{R} code is hidden
  in the document.
  
  \textbf{More Figure Stuff}
  
  Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the
  \texttt{out.extra} chunk option. (Currently this only works in the PDF
  version of the book.)
  \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[angle=180, scale=1.1]{figure/subdivision} \caption{A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down}\label{fig:subd2}
  \end{figure}
  As another example, here is a reference: Figure \ref{fig:subd2}.
  
  \section{Footnotes and Endnotes}\label{footnotes-and-endnotes}
  
  You might want to footnote something.\footnote{footnote text} The
  footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes
  work in much the same way. More information can be found about both on
  the CUS site or feel free to reach out to
  \href{mailto:data@reed.edu}{\nolinkurl{data@reed.edu}}.
  
  \section{Bibliographies}\label{bibliographies}
  
  Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate
  an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for
  creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In
  addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the
  free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. The Reed librarians have
  created Zotero documentation at
  \url{http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero}. In addition, a tutorial
  is available from Middlebury College at
  \url{http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/}.
  
  \emph{R Markdown} uses \emph{pandoc} (\url{http://pandoc.org/}) to build
  its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do
  a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To
  cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography
  database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede
  it by the ``at'' symbol. For example, here's a reference to a book about
  worrying: (Molina \& Borkovec, 1994). This \texttt{Molina1994} entry
  appears in a file called \texttt{thesis.bib} in the \texttt{bib} folder.
  This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.
  You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML
  header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the
  \texttt{bib} folder.
  
  For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site
  (\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html})\footnote{Reed~College
    (2007)}. There are three pages on this topic: \emph{bibtex} (which
  talks about using BibTeX, at
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html}),
  \emph{bibtexstyles} (about how to find and use the bibliography style
  that best suits your needs, at
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html}) and
  \emph{bibman} (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by
  hand, without BibTeX, at
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html}). The last page
  will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.
  
  If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can
  see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the
  appropriate csl file. You can download a variety of different style
  files at \url{https://www.zotero.org/styles}. Make sure to download the
  file into the csl folder.
  
  \textbf{Tips for Bibliographies}
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your
    bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in
    source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do
    it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination.
  \item
    The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other
    entries.
  \item
    When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate
    each author's name by the word ``and'' e.g.
    \texttt{Author\ =\ \{Noble,\ Sam\ and\ Youngberg,\ Jessica\},}.
  \item
    Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager)
    accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as
    necessary.
  \item
    To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is
    generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
  \item
    You can add a Reed Thesis citation\footnote{Noble (2002)} option. The
    best way to do this is to use the phdthesis type of citation, and use
    the optional ``type'' field to enter ``Reed thesis'' or
    ``Undergraduate thesis.''
  \end{itemize}
  \section{Anything else?}\label{anything-else}
  
  If you'd like to see examples of other things in this template, please
  contact the Data @ Reed team (email
  \href{mailto:data@reed.edu}{\nolinkurl{data@reed.edu}}) with your
  suggestions. We love to see people using \emph{R Markdown} for their
  theses, and are happy to help.
  
  \chapter*{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
  
  If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can
  add the \texttt{\{-\}} attribute.
  
  \textbf{More info}
  
  And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter
  title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are
  to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's
  obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add
  an indent there.
  
  \appendix
  
  \chapter{The First Appendix}\label{the-first-appendix}
  
  This first appendix includes all of the R chunks of code that were
  hidden throughout the document (using the \texttt{include\ =\ FALSE}
