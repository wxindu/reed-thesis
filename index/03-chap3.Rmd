# Inference for SCA

## Formalizing suggestions from paper

- Statistical Hypothesis for the inference test
- Three proposed test statistics and formalizations

## Conclusions of inferential tests

### statistical significance and interpretation
    

## Additional Inference

### Numerical values of estimates

1. Consider single SCA curve: define some statistics that describe how spread out the estimates are/how clustered the estimates are
2. Consider the inference of such statistic for permutation testing. 

### Inference on "Dominant sign"

- How "dominant" a sign is can we draw conclusion of pos/neg/neutral effect/relationship? (set up threshold)

### Outstanding combinations of specifications

- set of specifications which generate outstanding estimates, differing from the majority of the estimates. (In terms of signs)
