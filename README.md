## My Thesis Repo

Amy Orben published a paper *The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use* on Nature. The paper used a statistical method naming Specification Curve Analysis (SCA). This thesis attempts to look into the SCA and Orben's paper more closely. The research question is yet to be decided.
