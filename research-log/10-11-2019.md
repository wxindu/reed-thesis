## Research Log 10-11-2019

#### Things did and tried this week: 

- Read and understood the paper Garden of forking paths
    - Seems like Amy Orben's paper is having the similar issue mentioned in the paper, where one scientific hypothesis corresponds to multiple statistical hypothesis
- Working with datasets [Problems]
    - YRBS
        - So far only found data available in .dat format or in Microsoft Access
            - How to work with .dat format data file in r? 
            - The file in Microsoft Access is too large and cannot be exported to excel format easily. (Can split into different files and then export but will need quite a few files) Is there a more direct way to work with Microsoft Access data files in R or is it necessary to go through the steps of spliting, exporting and merging?
    - MCS
        - Data files found in .sav format (SPSS), successfully imported in R, but have issue joining dataset; multiple large data files
        - error message `error: std::bad-alloc`
        - Tried multiple times but not working
- Working with SCA using MTF [Problems]
    - When generating permutation distribution, each permutation and SCA takes 2 hours--And we need a distribution of permutations
        - Any efficient way of doing it? 
    - The results of the SCA generated using Orben's code has slight positive median coefficient--does not agree with Amy Orben's result. Still working on why it happened
        - Possible reasons
            - When the data was imported, the values of variables are strings as a combination of numbers and characters. Did some simple modification as all survey question variables seemed to have the same format (the dataset too large and did not verify carefully) Could be that the previous step transformed some variables in the wrong way and a better and more thorough modification of the variables is needed
        - Was planning on running the other SCAs first and see if the same problem exist there but was unsuccessful because of the issues addressed above
        - Ran the SCA again with only TV related variables as the x variables, have a higher positive regression coefficient. But the result is not yet reliable since we have not yet successfully replicate Amy Orben's results on MTF
- Read blogdown, have not yet started

#### Goals: 

- Fix the listed problems and try to replicate all Orben's result in the paper
- subset the x variables used by Amy Orben based on different type of technology use and run SCA separately on each one
- if can do permutation test more efficiently, do the alternative inference of SCA using different test statistic
- Start writing things and organize readings have been done; meanwhile look more into SCA and related methods
