## Research Log 12-17-2019

Did: 
- Literature research in psychology according to tech use vs. mental health
    - Found Psych literature/studies on why categorizing social network sites use into a general category of technology use is inappropriate
    - Psych studies looked at MCS specifically and proposed different measure to use as measure for mental health
    - Psych studies looked on similar problems using other datasets proposed different models, including quadratic linear regression etc. 
    - Generally more studies found negative association between some form of tech use with mental health or factors that can affect mental health.
    - Generally used an actual scientific measure of mental health instead of survey questions and/or use survey questions to construct one score assessing mental health
    - Current Psych studies on this problem does more detailed categorizing of techonologies. For example, when looking at the effect of using social networking sites, the recent studies tend to consider "passively usage" and "actively usage" separately. 
- Getting started on an outline for writing in literature research in psychology

Goal: 
- Literature research in SCA related. 
- Writings for Ch.1
