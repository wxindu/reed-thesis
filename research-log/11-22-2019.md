#### Things did: 
- Modified written contents
- Rewrote and tested a bootstrapping test for SCA for replication of Orben's work. Realized a big problem in her inference: 
 
  > A bootstrapping technique was therefore used to run 500 SCA tests on resampled data, where it is known that the null hypothesis is true.
 
  This is clearly not how Bootstrapping techniques are used for. I'll use a sentence from Wikipedia for what Bootstrapping really does: 
  
  > Bootstrapping is the practice of estimating properties of an estimator (such as its variance) by measuring those properties when sampling from an approximating distribution. 
- She should have conducted a permutation test there for the inference she was looking at. The permutation test code was modified and tested.
