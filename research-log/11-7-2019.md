#### Did: 
- Rewrote the code used for Permutation tests, transformed to a function that can be ran parallel. 
- Successful Permutation test for YRBS data. Time Shortened to about 9 hours with 8 cores and about 20 minutes with 96 cores. 
- Working on Permutation test for the MCS dataset. There's additional complexity in this case due to large number of specifications and the fact that two sets of models are involved in this study: 
    - One set of models use survey answers from children while the other set of model use survey answers from guardians. The two set of models were combined in Orben's study and considered as alternative model specifications. 

#### Goal: 
- Writing
- Enhancing code for Permutation tests for MCS
