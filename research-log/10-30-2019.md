## Research Log Update 10-30-2019

### Did:

#### YRBS
- Finished YRBS data modification, successfully replicated SCA results (beta = -0.035)
- Subset YRBS x variables, separated into TV use vs. Electronic Device use, ran separate SCA, get result: -0.012 for TV use, -0.071 for Electronic Device use. Interesting difference

#### MCS
- Subset x variables, ran SCA analysis on 5 x variables separately and found results: 
    - TV: -0.043
    - Games: -0.005
    - Internet: -0.071
    - Computer: 0.013
    - Social Media: -0.057
    
    In comparison to the general results found by Orben: -0.032. 
    
    One thing interesting is that computer, which refers to the use of own computer, is estimated to have positive effect.
    One idea for the next step: consider use some of the x variables here as control variables? 

#### MTF
- Redid the data research. Found separate data files for 2008 - 2016. Orben used a merged data file, however, I failed to find such a file. The variables in the datasets I obtained were all under different naming system. Will need LOTS of time to manually select and change the correct variables to use. Planning on continuing after the SCA analysis for the other ones finished.
