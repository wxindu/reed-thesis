## Important progress and findings: 

### "Corrected" SCA results

- Implemented an SCA using YRBS dataset, studied question: relationship b/t use of TV and losing hopes among teenagers
- The variables considered: 
    - independent variable: TV use in recent week
    - response variable: *Specifications*
        - have attempted suicide in the recent year
        - have felt hopeless in the recent year
        - have seriously considered suicide in the recent year
        - have planned suicide in the recent year
    - control variables: 
        - Computer use
        - Physical activity
        - *Specification* recent alcohol consumption
        - *Specification* recet hallucinogenic drug consumption
    - interactions: 
        - *Specification* interactions between (one of the) control variables and the independent variables
    - model form: 
        - logit
        - linear
    - Total 128 models ran
- Results: 
    - SCA plot produced
    - Overall: 
        - 75.56% positive estimates (Dominant sign positive)
        - 53.91% significant results
        - 48.44% positive significant results (majority of significant estimates are positive)
    - Of those with negative estimates: 
        - 60% include interactions w/ physical activity
        - 53.5% used attempt suicide as response
        - 50% include recent alcohol consumption as control
        - 46.6% include halluc durg consumption as control
        - 40% used serious consider suicide as response

### How specifications change sign of estimates

- On the sensitivity of a Regression Coefficient to Monotonic Transformations
    - Provided a method to examine the sensitivity of the sign of a regression coefficient to monotonic transformations of the variables. Including: 
        - If different monotonic transformations on variable would result in coefficients with different sign
        - How might the monotonic transformation look like to change the sign
    - Mainly used two definitions: 
        - Absolute concentration curve (ACC of X w.r.t Y: Cumulative value of X on vertical axis and cumulative dist of Y on horizontal axis)
            - Computationally very easy: 
                - "Cumulative dist of Y", or F(Y) is defined to be the rank of Y divide by the total number of observations
                - "Cumulative value of X_i" would simply be the mean value of X_j where j <= i
        - Line of Independence (line from (0,0) to (1, mean(X))
        - The difference between the two line represents the covariance of F(Y) and X. 
        - If two lines intersect, there would be two monotonic transformation (on Y, if ACC of X w.r.t Y) that result in different sign of estimates. If no intersection, the sign would not be changed by monotonic transformations. 
    - Mentioned two other useful information: 
        - [No access to the paper]"When a variable is dropped from a linear regression there can be no change in sign of any estimate that has a larger t-value than the one dropped from the regression"
        - [access to the paper] "Converse not generally true; deleting a high t-value variable is not necessarily sufficient to change the sign of other coef"
